Introduction
As leading AI scientists with expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we aim to delve into the mathematical foundations and advanced techniques that underpin these fields. We will explore the intricacies of multiple LLMs (multi-LLMs), indexing methods, and their applications, providing detailed explanations suitable for fellow researchers.

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
1.1 Text Representation
1.1.1 Bag-of-Words (BoW) Model

The BoW model represents text as a high-dimensional sparse vector, where each dimension corresponds to a word in the vocabulary.

Let ( V ) be the vocabulary size. For a document ( d ), the BoW representation is:
$$
\mathbf{x}_d = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_V]^T \quad \text{where} \quad x_i = \text{TF-IDF}(w_i, d)
$$

where $\text{TF-IDF}(w_i, d)$ is the term frequency-inverse document frequency of word ( w_i ) in document ( d ).

1.1.2 Word Embeddings

Word embeddings map words to continuous vector spaces, capturing semantic meaning.

Word2Vec Skip-Gram Model
The objective is to maximize the probability of context words ( w_{t+j} ) given the target word ( w_t ):

$$
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{-k \leq j \leq k, j \neq 0} \log P(w_{t+j} | w_t)
$$

Using softmax:

$$
P(w_O | w_I) = \frac{\exp(\mathbf{v}'{w_O}^\top \mathbf{v}{w_I})}{\sum_{w=1}^{V} \exp(\mathbf{v}'w^\top \mathbf{v}{w_I})}
$$

where $ \mathbf{v}{w_I} $ and $ \mathbf{v}'{w_O} $ are the input and output vector representations of words.

1.2 Sequence Modeling
1.2.1 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs process sequential data by maintaining hidden states.

$$
\mathbf{h}t = \sigma(\mathbf{W}{xh} \mathbf{x}t + \mathbf{W}{hh} \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_h)
$$

where $ \mathbf{h}_t $ is the hidden state at time $ t $, $ \mathbf{x}_t $ is the input, $ \sigma $ is an activation function.

1.2.2 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

LSTMs address the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs.

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{f}t &= \sigma(\mathbf{W}{xf} \mathbf{x}t + \mathbf{W}{hf} \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}f) \
\mathbf{i}t &= \sigma(\mathbf{W}{xi} \mathbf{x}t + \mathbf{W}{hi} \mathbf{h}{t-1} + \mathbf{b}i) \
\mathbf{o}t &= \sigma(\mathbf{W}{xo} \mathbf{x}t + \mathbf{W}{ho} \mathbf{h}{t-1} + \mathbf{b}o) \
\tilde{\mathbf{c}}t &= \tanh(\mathbf{W}{xc} \mathbf{x}t + \mathbf{W}{hc} \mathbf{h}{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_c) \
\mathbf{c}_t &= \mathbf{f}t \odot \mathbf{c}{t-1} + \mathbf{i}_t \odot \tilde{\mathbf{c}}_t \
\mathbf{h}_t &= \mathbf{o}_t \odot \tanh(\mathbf{c}_t)
\end{align*}
$$

1.2.3 Transformer Architecture

Transformers use self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrence.

Scaled Dot-Product Attention
$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{Q K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V
$$

where $ Q $, $ K $, and $ V $ are the query, key, and value matrices, $ d_k $ is the dimension of the keys.

2. Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs leverage the Transformer architecture to model complex language patterns.

2.1 Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
Used in models like BERT, MLM predicts masked tokens in a sequence.

Objective Function
$$
\mathcal{L}{\text{MLM}} = -\mathbb{E}{x \sim D} \left[ \sum_{i \in M} \log P(x_i | x_{-M}; \theta) \right]
$$

where $ M $ is the set of masked positions, $ x_{-M} $ is the input sequence with masks.

2.2 Autoregressive Language Modeling
Used in models like GPT, predicts the next token given previous tokens.

Objective Function
$$
\mathcal{L}{\text{LM}} = -\sum{t=1}^{T} \log P(x_t | x_{<t}; \theta)
$$

2.3 Scaling Laws
Model performance scales with data size (( D )), model parameters (( N )), and compute (( C )).

Empirical Scaling Law
$$
\epsilon \approx \left( \left( \frac{N}{N_0} \right)^{-\alpha_N} + \left( \frac{D}{D_0} \right)^{-\alpha_D} + \left( \frac{C}{C_0} \right)^{-\alpha_C} \right)
$$

where $ \epsilon $ is the error, $ \alpha_N, \alpha_D, \alpha_C $ are scaling exponents.

3. Multiple LLMs (Multi-LLMs)
Combining multiple LLMs can enhance performance and enable specialized functionalities.

3.1 Ensemble Methods
Aggregating predictions from multiple models to improve generalization.

Weighted Ensemble
$$
P(y|x) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i P_i(y|x)
$$

where $ P_i(y|x) $ is the probability from the $ i $-th model, and $ w_i $ are weights such that $ \sum w_i = 1 $.

3.2 Mixture of Experts (MoE)
Divides tasks among specialized expert models.

Gating Function
$$
G(\mathbf{x}) = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{W}_g \mathbf{x})
$$

MoE Output
$$
\hat{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} G_i(\mathbf{x}) E_i(\mathbf{x})
$$

where $ E_i(\mathbf{x}) $ is the output of the $ i $-th expert.

$$

where $ A_{ij} = 1 $ if term $ i $ appears in document $ j $.

4.2 Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search

$$

where ( \Delta ) is the quantization step size.

Knowledge Distillation
Training smaller models to mimic larger ones.

$$
\mathcal{L}{\text{KD}} = \alpha \mathcal{L}{\text{CE}} + (1 - \alpha) \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}
$$

where ( \mathcal{L}{\text{CE}} ) is cross-entropy with ground truth, ( \mathcal{L}{\text{KL}} ) is Kullback-Leibler divergence with the teacher model.

----
Representing text in a format understandable by machines is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This process involves converting textual data into numerical representations, preserving the semantic and syntactic information embedded in human language.

### Text Representation Techniques

*   **One-Hot Encoding:** This is the simplest method of representing words as vectors. Each word in a vocabulary is assigned a unique vector where only one element is 1 (representing the presence of the word), and all other elements are 0. Mathematically, for a vocabulary (V) of size (N), the one-hot vector (v∈ℝN) for word (wi) is:

    $$
    \mathbf{v}_i = [0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0]^T
    $$, where 1 is at the ith position corresponding to (wi).

    *   Advantages: Simplicity and preservation of distinct word identities.
    *   Limitations: High dimensionality (size of the vector equals vocabulary size), sparsity leading to inefficient computations, and lack of semantic relationship capture between words.
*   **Bag-of-Words (BoW) Model:** This model represents a document by counting the frequency of each word in it, disregarding grammar and word order but maintaining multiplicity. Given a document (D) and a vocabulary (V), the Bag-of-Words vector (d∈ℝN) is:

    $$
    \mathbf{d}_i = f(w_i, D)
    $$, where (f(wi,D)) represents the frequency count of word (wi) in document (D).

    *   Issue: **BoW vectors are often sparse, especially with large vocabularies, as most words do not appear in a given document**.
*   **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):**  TF-IDF enhances the BoW representation by scaling word frequencies based on their importance across all documents. It reduces the weight of common words and increases the weight of words specific to a document.  

    **Term Frequency (TF)** measures how frequently a term (t) occurs in a document (d):
    $$
    \text{TF}(t, d) = \frac{f(t, d)}{\sum_{t' \in V} f(t', d)}
    $$

    **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** measures the importance of a term across all documents (D):
    $$
    \text{IDF}(t, D) = \log\left( \frac{N}{1 + |{ d \in D : t \in d }|} \right)
    $$, where (N) is the total number of documents, and the denominator is the number of documents containing term (t).

    The **TF-IDF weight** for term (t) in document (d) is calculated as:
    $$
    \text{TF-IDF}(t, d, D) = \text{TF}(t, d) \times \text{IDF}(t, D)
    $$. This weighting scheme helps identify words that are both frequent within a document and rare across the entire corpus.

*   **N-gram Models:** N-grams are contiguous sequences of 'n' items in a text sequence. They capture local context by considering word order. An n-gram is a tuple ((wi,wi+1,...,wi+n−1)).

    *   Issue: **The number of possible n-grams increases exponentially as 'n' grows, leading to higher dimensionality and sparsity**.
*   **Distributed Representations (Word Embeddings):**  Word embeddings encode words into dense vectors that capture semantic meaning and relationships.

    *   **Word2Vec:** Word2Vec uses either the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) or Skip-Gram model to predict words based on their context.

        *   **CBOW** predicts a target word from surrounding context words.
        *   **Skip-Gram** predicts surrounding context words based on a target word.

        The **objective functions** for these models are:

        **CBOW Objective:**
        $$
        J_{\text{CBOW}} = -\sum_{w \in D} \log p(w | \text{context}(w))
        $$

        **Skip-Gram Objective:**
        $$
        J_{\text{Skip-Gram}} = -\sum_{w \in D} \sum_{c \in \text{context}(w)} \log p(c | w)
        $$

        Probability modeling uses the Softmax function:

        $$
        p(w_O | w_I) = \frac{\exp(\mathbf{v}{w_O}^T \mathbf{v}{w_I})}{\sum_{w' \in V} \exp(\mathbf{v}{w'}^T \mathbf{v}{w_I})}
        $$,

        where:

        *   (vwI) is the input vector of the target word
        *   (vwO) is the output vector of a context word

    *   **GloVe (Global Vectors):** GloVe leverages global word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus to generate word embeddings.

        **Cost Function:**
        $$
        J = \sum_{i,j=1}^{V} f(P_{ij}) \left( \mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{\tilde{v}}_j + b_i + \tilde{b}j - \log P{ij} \right)^2
        $$

        where:

        *   (Pij) is the probability of word (j) occurring in the context of word (i).
        *   (f) is a weighting function used to discount rare co-occurrences.
        *   (vi) and (ṽj) are the word vectors.

    *   **FastText:** FastText extends Word2Vec by representing words as sets of character n-grams. This captures subword information, which is useful for handling morphologically rich languages and out-of-vocabulary words.

        Let (Gw) be the set of n-grams for word (w), including the word itself. The word vector (vw) is the sum of its n-gram vectors:

        $$
        \mathbf{v}w = \sum{g \in G_w} \mathbf{z}_g
        $$, where (zg) is the vector representation of n-gram (g).

*   **Contextual Embeddings:** These embeddings capture the meaning of words in context, allowing for polysemy (words having multiple meanings) and context-dependent representations.

    *   **Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo):** ELMo computes word representations using a deep bidirectional LSTM language model.

        For a sequence of tokens ((t1,t2,...,tN)), the ELMo representation for token (tk) is:

        $$
        \text{ELMo}k = \gamma \sum{j=0}^{L} s_j h_{k}^{(j)}
        $$,

        where:

        *   (L) is the number of layers
        *   (h(j)k) is the hidden state of layer (j) at position (k)
        *   (sj) are softmax-normalized weights
        *   (γ) is a scalar parameter

    *   **Transformers:** Transformers utilize a self-attention mechanism to capture dependencies between words in a sentence regardless of their distance.

        **Scaled Dot-Product Attention:** Given queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V):

        $$
        \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{Q K^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V
        $$, where (dk) is the dimension of the key vectors.

        *   **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):**  BERT is pre-trained on two tasks: **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** (predicting masked words in a sequence) and **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)** (predicting if one sentence follows another).

            BERT Representation: For a token sequence, BERT generates contextual embeddings:

            $$
            \mathbf{H} = \text{Transformer}(\mathbf{E})
            $$,

            where:

            *   (E) represents input embeddings.
            *   (H) represents output embeddings from the Transformer encoder.

*   **Sentence and Document Embeddings:**

    *   **Averaging Word Embeddings:** This simple method averages the word embeddings in a sentence or document to create a single vector representation:

        $$
        \mathbf{v}{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{v}_{w_i}
        $$.

    *   **Doc2Vec:** Doc2Vec extends Word2Vec to generate vector representations for sentences, paragraphs, and documents.  It utilizes two models:

        *   **Distributed Memory (PV-DM)**: This model predicts a target word using context words and the document vector.
        *   **Distributed Bag of Words (PV-DBOW)**: This model predicts words in the document given the document vector.

        The **objective function** for PV-DM is:

        $$
        J = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \log p(w_i | D, w_{i-K}, ..., w_{i+K})
        $$,

        where:

        *   (D) is the document vector
        *   (K) is the context window size

    *   **Sentence Transformers:** This approach uses Siamese BERT networks to produce semantically meaningful sentence embeddings. For two sentences (s1) and (s2):

        $$
        \mathbf{u} = \text{BERT}(s_1), \quad \mathbf{v} = \text{BERT}(s_2)
        $$.

        Similarity between sentences is then computed using **cosine similarity**:

        $$
        \text{sim}(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{| \mathbf{u} | | \mathbf{v} |}
        $$.

*   **Character-Level Embeddings:** In this method, text is represented at the character level, enabling the capture of morphological information, which is especially useful for languages with complex morphology.  

    *   **Models:** Character-level embeddings often utilize Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for processing character sequences or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract n-gram features from character sequences.

        **Mathematical Formulation (Using CNNs)**:
        The convolution operation on character embeddings (C) is:

        $$
        \mathbf{h}i = \sigma(\mathbf{W} \cdot \mathbf{c}{i:i+k-1} + \mathbf{b})
        $$,

        where:

        *   (ci:i+k−1) is the concatenation of character embeddings from position (i) to (i+k−1)
        *   (W) is the filter weight matrix
        *   (σ) is an activation function

*   **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE):** BPE is a data compression technique adapted for tokenization. It splits words into subwords or tokens based on frequency.

    The BPE algorithm operates as follows:

    1.  Initialize the vocabulary with all characters present in the corpus.
    2.  Count the frequency of all symbol pairs.
    3.  Merge the most frequent pair ((a,b)) into a new symbol (ab).
    4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a predetermined number of merges.

    Mathematically: Let (V) be the initial vocabulary and (M) be the number of merge operations. After (M) merges, the new vocabulary (V') will have a size of (∣V∣+M).

### Conclusion

Text representation techniques have evolved from simple one-hot encodings to sophisticated models that capture contextual and semantic nuances of language. These methods, underpinned by mathematical formulations, allow machines to process and interpret human language, leading to advancements in NLP and AI research. From basic techniques to advanced models like BERT and Sentence Transformers, the field continues to evolve, enhancing the ability of machines to understand and process human language.
